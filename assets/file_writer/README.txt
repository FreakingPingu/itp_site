The following program appends multiline text to any specified line to all .html files in a given
directory. The text to append is given by editing the to_write.txt file in the same directory as
the .exe. (Note that blank lines at the start or end of the to_write.txt may result in odd or unusual
behavior.)

This program was made so that Stefan and I can save time and add a new feature across all webpages at
once, instead of copying and pasting across all files.
