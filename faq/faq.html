			<p class="question"> Does pi = 2? </p>
			<p class= "answer"> Yes. </p>
			<p class="question"> Are you sure? </p>
			<p class= "answer"> Now, you see. Some people insist that pi is always equal to 3.1415926... But this isn't necessarily true. All it takes is to EXPAND YOUR HORIZONS and use
            	a different measurement of distance. The taxi-cab metric. (SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES ABOUT WHY CUSTOMARY IS AWFUL.) Using the taxi-cab metric, our friend the dot can only travel left or right on the EUCLIDEAN plane. Only
                parallel to the Y or X axis. Since the definition of a circle (one defintion, anyway) is a shape in which all points are equidistant from the center (shut up people who say a circle is just a line that loops back on itself) our
                circle will wind up being a "diamond" shape, or a titled square. It will have a diameter of 2, and a circumference of 4. Since pi = c/d, c == 4 and d == 2, pi == 2.</p>
